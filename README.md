# Logue-App

Indonesia has at least 700 traditional languages, with Javanese and Sundanese being the two most widely spoken languages, according to Simons et al in his book “Ethnologue: Languages of the Worlds, Twenty-first Edition” (2019). Sadly, the majority of locals today do not speak the language of their own ethnic group, with more than 80 traditional languages currently in critically endangered status according to UNESCO. This could lead to the extinction of several traditional Indonesian languages. In order to avoid this, we have an intention to create a platform that will allow us to learn about Indonesian traditional language while also providing an “easy-to-learn”  and “fun-to-play” learning environment. Here are some of the research questions for our project based on this knowledge:
1. How to preserve Indonesian traditional languages from extinction?
2. How to create a fun and comprehensive curriculum that could provide the best experience in learning traditional languages?
3. How can the problem statement be resolved with current technology?

Our team is motivated to solve this issue because we want to preserve our traditional languages by making it simpler and give a fun experience for individuals to learn about various traditional Indonesian languages. Our objective is to create a language-learning app that provides the greatest learning platform for Indonesian traditional language.
